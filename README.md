## Welcome to Garden's Three Tier Web App Example ðŸ‘‹

This repository contains the three tier web app that's used in the ['Your First Project' tutorial](https://docs.garden.io/tutorials/your-first-project) from our documentation.

- If you're coming from the tutorial, checkout out to the [`tutorial-start`](https://github.com/garden-io/web-app-example/tree/tutorial-start) branch to follow along.
- If you're coming from the tutorial but can't wait to see the end result, checkout out to the [`tutorial-complete`](https://github.com/garden-io/web-app-example/tree/tutorial-complete) branch.

If you see any issues or bugs, kindly report them to the [main Garden repo](https://github.com/garden-io/garden/issues/new).

## About the project

The project is a simplified version of the microservice voting application you'll find in various Garden examples. Garden is typically used in projects that have multiple microservices but
sometimes its better to keep things simple and here we have a three-tier web app version with API, web and database components.

### Garden Providers

The `main` branch uses the `local-kubernetes` provider. The [tutorial from our documentation](https://docs.garden.io/tutorials/your-first-project) however goes into more detail and discusses the different options for deploying the project to Kubernetes.

### Garden Actions

The project is a voting application with the following components:

- `web` â€” A frontend Vue application
- `api` â€” A Python API server
- `db` â€” A Postgres database

These services are built, deployed, and tested with [Garden actions](https://docs.garden.io/overview/core-concepts#action).

Specifically, the `api` and `web` components have their own Kubernetes manifests so we use the `container` Build action to build them
and the `kubernetes` Deploy action to deploy them.

The `db` component is an "off the shelf" Postgres Helm chart that's deployed via the `helm` Deploy action.
